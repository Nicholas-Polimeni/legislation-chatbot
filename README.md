# legislation-chatbot

### What is this?
An intelligent, ChatGPT-like chatbot for asking about US legislation, built on
cutting-edge LLMs and a database of thousands of Congressional documents. It is
also accessible as an API.

### Why?
Federal legislation impacts the entire nation, but there are hundreds
of thousands of documents to sift through. Unfortunately, that makes it
possible to hide important changes from the people. Use it to learn more about
issues you care about or even as a research assistant.

### How?
Utilizing the Congress API, sentence transformers, Google Cloud functions, and
built off of Anthropic's Claude-2 (shout-out to Anthropic for
providing an API key!), we've created a complex retrieval-augmented generative AI to answer your
queries.

### How do I use this?
Try to ask about bills related to a topic you care about, ask for details about
a specific bill, or anything you think is important! **Power to the people :fist:**

for topics you care about)!
